  <p>At the end of 2019, the team and I ran a reader survey. We wanted to see what you liked, didn’t like, and wanted from us in the future. There were some interesting and helpful suggestions in there.</p>
  <p>I read through over a thousand responses as I wanted to see what you wanted from us. You can’t get better without feedback, and we always want to make sure we’re serving your needs.</p>
  <p>So, as we make our way through this year, I wanted to share with you some changes you can expect to see on the website:</p>
  <p><strong>First, we’re continuing to bring on new voices to write for us.<span> </span></strong>You might have noticed that we’re having more guest posts to more destinations! We’re currently looking for articles about:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>LGBT content: stories by transgender people, queer couples, and solo gay, lesbian, or bi travelers</li>
    <li>Africa-related content (bonus points if it’s East or Central Africa)</li>
    <li>Middle East–related content</li>
    <li>Central Asia–related content</li>
    <li>India-related content</li>
    <li>China-related content</li>
    <li>Technology- or gear-related content</li>
    <li>Senior/Older travel</li>
    <li>Family travel</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you want to write for us, check out our<span> </span><a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/write-for-matt/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">guidelines page.</a></p>
  <p><strong>Second, I plan to write more travel stories this year.</strong><span> </span>We do a lot of brass-tacks, hard-numbers stuff here. The nuts and bolts of travel. Practical information.</p>
  <p>But last year,<span> </span><a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/ten-years-a-nomad/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">writing my book</a><span> </span>inspired me to get into more storytelling. So this year, as I make my way around the world,
    I’m making an effort to create more stories about the places I visit — their history, people, and culture. So you’ll see such content popping up with more frequency.</p>
  <p>And you’ll see more history and culture in our how-to posts too. I want to start painting a more holistic view of each destination we write about.</p>
  <p><strong>Third, we’re going to be hosting a lot more events this year.</strong><span> </span>We’ve started<span> </span><a href="https://thenomadicnetwork.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Nomadic Network</a><span> </span>so we can
    do more in-person events this year. We really want to take this online community offline, so we’re building a great website for that and hosting lots of events.</p>
  <p>For more information and ways you can get involved,<span> </span><a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/introducing-the-nomadic-network/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">check this post out</a>.</p>
  <p><strong>Fourth, a lot of you suggested topics you wanted to see, so we’re busy making that happen!</strong><span> </span>Some of the topics you’ll start to see more of over the course of the year are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Eco-travel</li>
    <li>Traveling with pets</li>
    <li>Family/kid-friendly travel</li>
    <li>Traveling when you’re older</li>
    <li>How to make friends when you travel</li>
    <li>How to make the most of your time</li>
    <li>How to save more money BEFORE you go</li>
    <li>Off-beat destinations</li>
    <li>“Thematic” ways to see a city</li>
    <li>Reader stories</li>
    <li>Ways to volunteer</li>
    <li>Itinerary posts</li>
    <li>And a bunch more!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Obviously, I can’t write all the time (or expertly on all these topics), which is why we’re going to be bringing in a few more regular contributors and writers now. So not only will you be seeing more content, you’ll be seeing a lot more diverse voices
    on the website too.</p>
  <p>And, as a sidebar to that: since we have so much content now, we’re going to be doing a new redesign in the middle of the year so the site will be easier to navigate.</p>
  <p>That’s it! Those are our big plans! We’re super excited about what’s in store for this year.</p>
  <p>– Matt</p>
