  <h2>The benefits of wearing cotton clothing</h2>
  <p>Dependable, moisture-wicking and perfect for any occasion, cotton is one of our favourite things to wear. Who would have thought this little fluffy plant could create so much comfort? Here are just a few reasons we love cotton clothing.<a href="../RoboHelp_Features/DCF_File.docx">DCF_File.docx</a></p>

  <h4>Temperature control</h4>
  <p>Breathable cotton clothes are hard to beat when it comes to finding outfits for all seasons. They&#39;ll keep you cool on stuffy summer days, and provide just the right amount of insulation on a cold autumnal evening. The perfect choice when it comes to the unpredictable British weather!</p>

  <h4>Durability <a href="../RoboHelp_Features/Defects.xlsx">Defects.xlsx</a></h4>
  <p>One of the things we love most about our White Stuff cotton clothing is that it&#39;s hardy. Whether you&#39;re weeding the garden or keeping up with the kids, cotton isn&#39;t afraid to get its hands dirty. Tightly woven fibres keep it strong, making it perfect for withstanding washing machines. Plus, cotton doesn&#39;t retain odours like other fabrics so it doesn&#39;t need to be washed as regularly – great for the environment (and your energy bills)!<a href="../RoboHelp_Features/result.txt">result.txt</a></p>

  <h4>Style<a href="../RoboHelp_Features/Global.pdf">Global.pdf</a></h4>
  <p>White Stuff&#39;s cotton clothing is designed to flatter. Loose silhouettes, lovely shapes and ultra-soft weaves mean cotton is a pleasure to wear. Team a cotton top with jeans and pumps for a staple day look and pick a cotton shift dress for special occasions. As cotton can be weaved into lace, jersey, velour and twill, this material is far from boring, and our quirky touches make every garment unique. Think contrasting hems, figure-flattering darts and patterns aplenty.</p>
